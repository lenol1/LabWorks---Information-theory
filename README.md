# LabWorks - Information theory
 
## Laboratory 1: Fundamentals of Information Theory
Objective: Study of basic concepts of information theory, such as entropy, amount of information and redundancy.
Task: Calculation of entropy for various message sources and analysis of their information characteristics.

## Laboratory 2: Coding of memoryless sources
Objective: Introduction to methods of encoding memoryless sources, in particular Huffman codes.
Task: Development of an algorithm for encoding and decoding messages using a Huffman code.

## Laboratory 3: Coding with error detection and correction
Objective: Study of coding methods that allow detecting and correcting errors that occur during data transmission.
Task: Implementation of cyclic coding algorithms and verification of their effectiveness in detecting and correcting errors.

## Laboratory 4: Cryptographic methods of information protection
Objective: Study of basic cryptographic methods of encrypting and decrypting information.
Task: Implementation and analysis of classical ciphers, such as the Vigen√®re cipher and permutation ciphers.
